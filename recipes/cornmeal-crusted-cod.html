            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Crispy cornmeal-crusted cod takes a quick dip in lime juice for an extra flavor before pan frying.  Is there really anything better than fried fish?</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>12 cod filets</li>
                <li>1/4 cup lime juice</li>
                <li>2/3 cup cornmeal</li>
                <li>2/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
                <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
                    <p>Rinse cod filets with water.  Pat fish dry.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
                    <p>Place lime juice in a shallow bowl.  Whisk cornmeal, flour, salt, and pepper together in a separate bowl.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
                    <p>Heat oil and butter in a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat.  Using tongs, dip cod in lime juice; allow excess to drip off.  Press fish into cornmeal mixture to coat on all sides; side asideon a plate.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
                    <p>Fry cod in the hot skillet until crispy golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.  Turn and fry until fish flakes easily with a fork and is golden brown on the other side; about 1 minute more.  Cooking time will depend on thinkness of filets.  You may have to fry in batches.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Step 5</strong></p>
                    <p>Remove fish to a wire rack set over a drip tray to catch any excess oil.  Serve immediately.</p>
